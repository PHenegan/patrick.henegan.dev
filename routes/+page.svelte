  I'm a 4th year student at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration
  in Computer Systems. I enjoy learning about anything related to computer science. I am especially
  interested in topics related to backend design and low level logic, such as computer graphics,
  networks communication, operating systems, and data processing.

  One of my favorite aspects of Computer Science is the many different ways to approach problems.
  Whether it's through different algoriths, programming languages, frameworks, or design architectures,
  There are endless ways to view each problem. I believe experiencing different methods of writing
  code has made me a better programmer, and I am always open to learning new technologies and
  paradigms to solve problems.
